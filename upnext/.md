Of course. You've built a robust and impressive foundation. To make your project even more advanced and to further address the core challenges of the problem statement—**early detection, reducing stigma, and data-driven policy**—we can now focus on evolving the system from being *reactive* to being *proactive and deeply integrated*.

Here are four advanced features you can implement, moving from a system that *provides* support to a system that *anticipates needs* and *measures impact*.

---

### Feature 1: Proactive Mental Health Check-ins & Predictive Risk Flagging

**Problem it Solves:** The current system relies on students initiating contact when they are already in distress. This feature addresses the *"lack of early detection and preventive mental health tools."*

**How to Implement It:**

1.  **Backend (`server`):**
    *   **New Mongoose Model (`studentCheckin.model.js`):**
        *   `studentId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Student' }`
        *   `checkinDate: { type: Date, default: Date.now }`
        *   `moodScore: { type: Number, min: 1, max: 5 }` (1=Very Bad, 5=Very Good)
        *   `stressLevel: { type: Number, min: 1, max: 5 }`
        *   `openEndedFeedback: { type: String }` (Optional)
    *   **New Cron Job / Scheduled Task:** Use a library like `node-cron` to run a task weekly or bi-weekly. This task will send a "gentle nudge" notification to all active students who haven't completed a check-in recently.
    *   **New Controller & Routes:**
        *   `POST /api/students/checkin`: Endpoint for students to submit their check-in data.
        *   `GET /api/students/checkin/history`: Endpoint for a student to see their mood/stress trend over time.
    *   **Update `Notification` Model:** Add a new `type`: `'checkin_reminder'`.

2.  **Analytic Agentic Server (`analytic-agentic-server`):**
    *   **Update `DataFetcher`:** Add a function to fetch all `studentCheckin` data.
    *   **New Analytic Agent (`predictive_risk_analyzer`):**
        *   This agent analyzes trends in the check-in data.
        *   It can identify students with a consistently low or declining `moodScore` or a persistently high `stressLevel` over several weeks.
        *   **Advanced Logic:** It can cross-reference this data with report submission frequency. For example, a student with declining mood scores who has also recently submitted a high-priority report is a high-risk candidate for proactive outreach.
        *   **Output:** The agent generates a list of anonymized student IDs with a calculated "risk score" and a justification (e.g., "Declining mood for 3 consecutive weeks"). This data would be saved in a new field in the `AnalyticsSnapshot` model, like `proactiveOutreachSuggestions`.

3.  **Frontend (`web`):**
    *   **New Component (`MoodCheckinForm`):** A simple, non-intrusive modal or page where students can quickly tap their mood (e.g., using emoji ratings) and stress level.
    *   **New Student Page (`student/wellness-trends/page.tsx`):** A page where students can see a graph of their own check-in history, helping them self-monitor their mental wellness.
    *   **Update Admin Dashboard:** Add a new section in the "Advanced Analytics" page to display the `proactiveOutreachSuggestions`, allowing administrators or counsellors to decide on intervention strategies.

**Why it's Advanced:** This feature shifts your platform from a passive support tool to an active early detection system, directly addressing the need for preventive mental health care.

### Feature 2: Personalized Psychoeducational Pathways

**Problem it Solves:** The current resource hub is a library. This feature turns it into a guided, personalized curriculum, increasing engagement and making the resources more effective. It enhances the *"Psychoeducational Resource Hub"* and makes it more accessible.

**How to Implement It:**

1.  **AI Backend (`agentic-server`):**
    *   **New Agent (`learning_path_generator`):**
        *   This agent is triggered after an AI report is generated.
        *   **Input:** The key stressors, concerns, and screening scores from the report.
        *   **Logic:** It queries your `PsychoeducationalResource` collection (via an API call to your Node.js server) for resources tagged with the relevant categories (e.g., "anxiety," "sleep," "study skills") and language.
        *   **Output:** It curates a structured "pathway," which is a sequenced list of resources. For example: `Pathway: Managing Exam Stress`.
            1.  **Video:** "5-Minute Breathing Exercise for Focus"
            2.  **Article:** "Effective Study Techniques to Reduce Cramming"
            3.  **Document:** "A Guide to Overcoming Test Anxiety"
            4.  **Audio:** "Guided Meditation for a Restful Sleep"
        *   This pathway is saved as a new field within the `AIReport` model's `standard_report` and `demo_report` JSON.

2.  **Backend (`server`):**
    *   **Update `AIReport` Model:** Add a `learningPathway` field (which can store the JSON output from the new agent).
    *   **Update `Student` Model:** Add a field to track student progress on these pathways, e.g., `completedResources: [mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId]`.
    *   **New Controller & Route:** `POST /api/students/resources/:resourceId/complete` for students to mark a resource as completed.

3.  **Frontend (`web`):**
    *   **Update `DemoReportDisplay.tsx`:** Create a new UI component to beautifully render the `learningPathway`. It should show the steps, allow users to click through to the resources, and include a "Mark as Complete" button for each item.
    *   **New Student Page (`student/my-pathways/page.tsx`):** A central place for students to view all their assigned learning pathways and track their progress.

**Why it's Advanced:** It moves beyond simple resource listing to provide structured, actionable guidance, improving the likelihood that students will engage with and benefit from the psychoeducational content.

### Feature 3: Intervention Impact Measurement Dashboard

**Problem it Solves:** Addresses the need for a *"data-driven policy framework."* Institutions run wellness programs but rarely know if they work. This feature allows them to measure the impact of their interventions.

**How to Implement It:**

1.  **Backend (`server`):**
    *   **New Mongoose Model (`intervention.model.js`):**
        *   `name: { type: String, required: true }` (e.g., "Campus-Wide Mindfulness Workshop")
        *   `description: { type: String }`
        *   `startDate: { type: Date, required: true }`
        *   `endDate: { type: Date, required: true }`
        *   `targetAudience: { type: String }` (e.g., "All Students," "2nd Year Engineering")
    *   **New Admin Controller & Routes:** Full CRUD (`Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`) for these `Intervention` documents.

2.  **Frontend (`web`):**
    *   **New Admin Page (`admin/interventions/page.tsx`):** A UI for admins to log the interventions they are conducting on campus.
    *   **Update Advanced Analytics Page (`admin/analytics/page.tsx`):**
        *   Add a "Compare Snapshots" feature.
        *   Allow the admin to select an `Intervention` from a dropdown.
        *   The UI will then automatically select the `AnalyticsSnapshot` from *before* the intervention's `startDate` and the one from *after* its `endDate`.
        *   Display side-by-side comparisons of key metrics:
            *   Did average anxiety scores (`avgGAD7`) decrease?
            *   Did the frequency of "Exam Stress" as a top stressor go down?
            *   Did student engagement increase?

3.  **Analytic Agentic Server (`analytic-agentic-server`):**
    *   No major changes are needed initially, as this feature primarily relies on comparing existing snapshots. Later, you could make the agents "intervention-aware" to perform more complex statistical analysis.

**Why it's Advanced:** This feature provides a closed feedback loop for institutional policy, allowing administrators to make evidence-based decisions about their mental wellness programs. It provides a tangible ROI for the platform.

### Feature 4: Structured & Themed Peer Support Sessions

**Problem it Solves:** The current peer support is a general chat room. This can be intimidating or unfocused. This feature addresses the *"stigma-free delivery"* and *"fear of judgment"* by creating more structured, safer environments.

**How to Implement It:**

1.  **Backend (`server`):**
    *   **New Mongoose Model (`scheduledSession.model.js`):**
        *   `topic: { type: String, required: true }` (e.g., "Coping with Homesickness")
        *   `description: { type: String }`
        *   `scheduledTime: { type: Date, required: true }`
        *   `durationMinutes: { type: Number, default: 60 }`
        *   `volunteerModerator: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Volunteer' }`
        *   `attendees: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Student' }]`
        *   `sessionTranscript: { type: String }` (Anonymized, for later analysis)
    *   **New Volunteer Controller & Routes:**
        *   `POST /api/volunteers/sessions/schedule`: Allows trained volunteers to schedule a session.
        *   `GET /api/students/sessions/upcoming`: Allows students to see and sign up for upcoming sessions.
    *   **Socket.IO Enhancements (`server/server.js`):**
        *   Create dynamic, temporary rooms for these scheduled sessions.
        *   Give the `volunteerModerator` special privileges in that room (e.g., mute, pin message with discussion prompts).

2.  **Frontend (`web`):**
    *   **New Student Page (`student/group-sessions/page.tsx`):** A calendar-like view where students can see and RSVP for upcoming themed sessions.
    *   **New Volunteer Page (`volunteer/my-sessions/page.tsx`):** A dashboard for volunteers to schedule new sessions and see who has signed up for their upcoming ones.
    *   **Update Chat UI:** When entering a scheduled session, the UI could be slightly different, perhaps showing the topic and discussion prompts pinned at the top.

**Why it's Advanced:** It elevates the peer support platform from a simple chat to a structured, therapeutic tool. Themed sessions are less intimidating for new users and provide more focused support, directly combating stigma and fear of judgment.
